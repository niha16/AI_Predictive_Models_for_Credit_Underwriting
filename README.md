## Introduction

Loan default prediction is a critical task for financial institutions to reduce risks. This project automates the prediction of whether a loan will default based on various applicant details, loan features, and credit history, providing quick and accurate predictions to assist lenders in their decision-making process.

## Features

- **Predictive Modeling**: Uses a Light Gradient Boosting model to predict loan default risk.
- **Real-Time Predictions**: Available through both a Flask API and a Streamlit web app.
- **Feature Importance Analysis**: Highlights the key factors influencing loan default prediction.
- **Robust Input Handling**: Efficient handling of missing or invalid inputs.
- **Chatbot Integration**: A chatbot interface allows users to easily interact with the system for loan default predictions in a conversational manner.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - **Machine Learning**: `scikit-learn`, `numpy`, `pandas`, `lightgbm`
  - **Visualization**: `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
  - **Web Application**: `streamlit`, `flask`
  - **Chatbot**: `streamlit-chatbot`, `GROQ`,`gemma2-9b-it`
- **Deployment**: Docker, Gunicorn, Nginx

## Dataset

- **Source**: [Dataset Source](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/laotse/credit-risk-dataset)
- **Attributes**:
  - **Demographic**: `person_age`, `person_income`, `person_home_ownership`, `person_emp_length`
  - **Loan Details**: `loan_amnt`, `loan_int_rate`, `loan_intent`, `loan_grade`
  - **Credit History**: `cb_person_cred_hist_length`, `cb_person_default_on_file`
- Categorical features are one-hot encoded, and missing values are imputed during preprocessing.

## Model and Approach

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handled missing values and one-hot encoded categorical variables.
   - Scaled numerical features for compatibility with machine learning models.

2. **Model**:
   - The model was trained using multiple classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, AdaBoost, and LightGBM.
   - **Final Model**: Light Gradient Boosting (LightGBM) was selected for its efficiency and high accuracy.

3. **Evaluation**:
   - Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score.
   - LightGBM achieved an accuracy of approximately 93% and an F1-score of around 82%.

4. **Deployment**:
   - The model is deployed with a Flask API and a Streamlit app for real-time interaction.

## Web Application

The Streamlit web application allows users to input loan details and receive a loan default prediction.

### Key Features:
- Simple form-based interface to input loan details.
- Instant loan default predictions with easy-to-understand explanations.

### Live Demo:
[AI Predictive Models for Loan Default Prediction - Streamlit App](https://jatinsharma496-ai-predictive-models-for-loan-default-prediction.streamlit.app/)

## Flask API

The Flask API serves as an interface to interact with the trained loan default prediction model, enabling integration with other systems.

### Key Features:
- POST endpoint to submit loan details and receive a default prediction.
- Handles JSON input and output, ensuring easy integration.
- Robust error handling for invalid input.

### Example Request:

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
    "person_age": 30,
    "person_income": 50000,
    "person_home_ownership": "MORTGAGE",
    "person_emp_length": 10.0,
    "loan_intent": "PERSONAL",
    "loan_grade": "A",
    "loan_amnt": 20000,
    "loan_int_rate": 6.5,
    "cb_person_default_on_file": "N",
    "cb_person_cred_hist_length": 5
}' http://localhost:5000/predict
```

### Example Response:

```json
{
  "prediction": "No Default"
}
```

## Chatbot Integration

A conversational AI chatbot has been integrated into the system to provide a more interactive and user-friendly experience. The chatbot guides users through the process of entering their loan details and provides predictions in real time.

### Key Features:
- **Interactive**: Users can chat with the system to enter loan details in a conversational manner.
- **Prediction**: The chatbot uses the trained machine learning model to predict whether the loan will default.
- **User-Friendly**: The chatbot interface simplifies the process of loan default prediction for end-users.

### Chatbot Demo:
- The chatbot is available in the [Streamlit App](https://jatinsharma496-ai-predictive-models-for-loan-default-prediction.streamlit.app/), where users can interact with the model in a chat-based format to predict loan defaults.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JatinSharma496/AI_Predictive_Models_for_Loan_Default_Prediction.git
   cd AI_Predictive_Models_for_Loan_Default_Prediction
   ```

2. **Set Up Virtual Environment**:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Flask API**:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

5. **Run the Streamlit App**:

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## Usage

- **Flask API**: Send POST requests to `http://localhost:5000/predict` with loan details in JSON format or use Postman.
- **Streamlit App**: Navigate to `http://localhost:8501` to input loan details and receive a prediction.
- **Chatbot**: Use the chatbot feature within the Streamlit app to interact with the loan default prediction model.

## Results

The model has been trained and evaluated, achieving high accuracy and providing valuable insights on loan default risk. Key features such as `person_income` and `loan_amnt` have a significant impact on predictions.
